/// The entry point for submitting feedback.
///
/// Build one `FeedbackClient` at app start, hold a reference, and call
/// ``submit(_:)`` from anywhere. The client itself is a value type — it stores
/// a transport and a closure for collecting ``DeviceInfo``, and is safe to
/// pass across actor boundaries.
///
/// ## Two ways to construct
///
/// The common case uses ``init(appName:transport:analytics:)``, which collects
/// ``DeviceInfo`` lazily on every submission:
///
/// ```swift
/// let feedback = FeedbackClient(
///     appName: "AcmeApp",
///     transport: GitHubDirectTransport(owner: "acme", repo: "feedback", token: token)
/// )
/// ```
///
/// For tests or fully deterministic submissions, freeze a ``DeviceInfo``
/// instance with ``init(transport:deviceInfo:analytics:)``:
///
/// ```swift
/// let feedback = FeedbackClient(
///     transport: NoOpTransport(),
///     deviceInfo: DeviceInfo(...)
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Why lazy device info
///
/// A long-lived client built at app start might submit feedback hours or
/// days later, possibly across an app update. Collecting ``DeviceInfo``
/// per submission means the version and OS reported always reflect the
/// process state at submission time, not at client construction time.

    ///     nowhere else: `FeedbackSheet` reads it from the client,
